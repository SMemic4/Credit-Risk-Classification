# Credit Risk Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify individuals as either low or high credit risks based on their attributes. Using the publicly available German Credit Risk dataset, the objective is to not only build an accurate predictive model but also understand the data through exploratory data analysis. The project incorporates advanced modeling techniques to optimize performance and assess key factors influencing credit risk classification.
